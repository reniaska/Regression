_This content of the task and csv file was taken from The Data Science Course: Complete Data Science Bootcamp 2023_

__Description:__

You are given a real estate dataset.

The data is located in the file: 'real_estate_price_size_year.csv'.

You are expected to create a multiple linear regression with and without standardizing data.

Apart from that, please:

* Display the intercept and coefficient(s)
* Find the R-squared and Adjusted R-squared
* Compare the R-squared and the Adjusted R-squared
* Using the model make a prediction about an apartment with size 750 sq.ft. from 2009
* Find the univariate p-values of the two variables. What can you say about them?
* Create a summary table with your findings

In this exercise, the dependent variable is 'price', while the independent variables are 'size' and 'year'.
